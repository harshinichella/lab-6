  <li>Remember to add the ".md" as the file type. It's a language called markdown; which allows you to use inline HTML or just type plain text.</li>
  <li>Here's the link to markdown sytanx https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax</li>
  <li>It is also important to use the readme file by updating it with path decisions and important "about" information.</li>
